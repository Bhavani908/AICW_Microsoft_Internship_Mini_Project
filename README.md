# AICW_Microsoft_Internship_Mini_Project
**Simple Fitness Tracker**

A console-based application built with Python to track daily physical activities. This project demonstrates the practical application of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and File Handling using plain text files.

🚀 **Features**
_User Profile Management_:  Store basic user information like Name, Age, and Weight.
_Workout Logging_:  Record workout details including Date, Exercise Type, Duration, and Calories Burned.
_Data Persistence_: Save your records to a .txt file and load them back later so you never lose your progress.
_History Tracking_: Display a formatted list of all previous workout entries.


🛠️ **Concepts Covered**
This project implements core programming fundamentals:
_Classes & Objects_: Separate classes for User and Workout to manage data efficiently.
_File Handling_: Reading from and writing to text files using Python's built-in open() functions.
_Data Encapsulation_: Keeping user data and their workout history organized within a single User object.
_Input Validation_: Basic logic to handle user inputs and navigation through a menu-driven interface.
