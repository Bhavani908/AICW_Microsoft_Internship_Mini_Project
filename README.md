# AICW_Microsoft_Internship_Mini_Project
Simple Fitness Tracker
A console-based application built with Python to track daily physical activities. This project demonstrates the practical application of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and File Handling using plain text files.
🚀 Features
User Profile Management: Store basic user information like Name, Age, and Weight.
Workout Logging: Record workout details including Date, Exercise Type, Duration, and Calories Burned.
Data Persistence: Save your records to a .txt file and load them back later so you never lose your progress.
History Tracking: Display a formatted list of all previous workout entries.
🛠️ Concepts Covered
This project implements core programming fundamentals:
Classes & Objects: Separate classes for User and Workout to manage data efficiently.
File Handling: Reading from and writing to text files using Python's built-in open() functions.
Data Encapsulation: Keeping user data and their workout history organized within a single User object.
Input Validation: Basic logic to handle user inputs and navigation through a menu-driven interface.
